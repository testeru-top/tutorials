appium:uninstallOtherPackages | Allows to set one or more comma-separated package identifiers to be uninstalled from the device before a test starts  
appium:allowTestPackages | If set to `true` then it would be possible to use packages built with the test flag for the automated testing (literally adds `-t` flag to the `adb install` command). `false` by default  
appium:remoteAppsCacheLimit | Sets the maximum amount of application packages to be cached on the device under test. This is needed for devices that don't support streamed installs (Android 7 and below), because ADB must push app packages to the device first in order to install them, which takes some time. Setting this capability to zero disables apps caching. `10` by default.  
appium:enforceAppInstall | If set to `true` then the application under test is always reinstalled even if a newer version of it already exists on the device under test. `false` by default  
  
### App Localization  
  
Capability Name | Description

appium:buildToolsVersion | The version of Android build tools to use. By default UiAutomator2 driver uses the most recent version of build tools installed on the machine, but sometimes it might be necessary to give it a hint (let say if there is a known bug in the most recent tools version). Example: `28.0.3`  
appium:skipLogcatCapture | Being set to `true` disables automatic logcat output collection during the test run. `false` by default  
appium:suppressKillServer | Being set to `true` prevents the driver from ever killing the ADB server explicitly. Could be useful if ADB is connected wirelessly. `false` by default  
appium:ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError | Being set to `true` ignores a failure while changing hidden API access policies. Could be useful on some devices, where access to these policies has been locked by its vendor. `false` by default.  
appium:mockLocationApp | Sets the package identifier of the app, which is used as a system mock location provider since Appium 1.18.0+. This capability has no effect on emulators. If the value is set to `null` or an empty string, then Appium will skip the mocked location provider setup procedure. Defaults to Appium Setting package identifier (`io.appium.settings`).  
appium:logcatFormat | The log print format, where `format` is one of: `brief` `process` `tag` `thread` `raw` `time` `threadtime` `long`. `threadtime` is the default value.

### App Signing  
  
Capability Name | Description  
--- | ---  
appium:useKeystore | Whether to use a custom keystore to sign the app under test. `false` by default, which means apps are always signed with the default Appium debug certificate (unless canceled by `noSign` capability). This capability is used in combination with `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities.  
appium:keystorePath | The full path to the keystore file on the server filesystem. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default

appium:noSign | Set it to `true` in order to skip application signing. By default all apps are always signed with the default Appium debug signature if they don't have any. This capability cancels all the signing checks and makes the driver to use the application package as is. This capability does not affect `.apks` packages as these are expected to be already signed.  
  
### Device Locking  
  
Capability Name | Description  
--- | ---  
appium:skipUnlock | Whether to skip the check for lock screen presence (`true`). By default UiAutomator2 driver tries to detect if the device's screen is locked before starting the test and to unlock that (which sometimes might be unstable). Note, that this operation takes some time, so it is highly recommended to set this capability to `true` and disable screen locking on devices under test.  
appium:unlockType | Set one of the possible types of Android lock screens to unlock. Read the [Unlock tutorial](https://github.com/appium/appium-android-driver/blob/master/docs/UNLOCK.md) for more details.
